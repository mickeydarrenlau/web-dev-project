# Pokédex Project - Grand STEM Challenge 2023

Welcome to the Pokédex Project, a training material for the Grand STEM Challenge 2023 Web Development Course! This hands-on web development project will introduce you to the fascinating world of Pokémon while honing your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.

## Project Overview

In this course, you will design and build an interactive Pokédex using HTML, [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and JavaScript. The Pokédex will allow users to explore information about various Pokémon species, including their names, types, descriptions, heights, and weights. For accessing Pokémon data, we'll use the [pokeapi-js-wrapper](https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokeapi-js-wrapper) library.

### Learning Objectives

- Gain a solid understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals.
- Learn how to create an appealing and responsive user interface for a web application using Tailwind CSS.
- Practice working with JavaScript data structures and dynamically updating content on the page.
- Implement user interactions such as catching and releasing Pokémon and implementing a search feature.
- Utilize the pokeapi-js-wrapper to fetch Pokémon data and display it in the Pokédex.
- Get familiar with version control using Git and GitHub for collaborative development.

### Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions provided in the course material to build the Pokédex.
3. Experiment and explore additional features to enhance your project further.

### Contributing

As this project is meant for learning purposes, feel free to experiment and make improvements to your own Pokédex! Share your creativity and unique features with your fellow learners.

### Course Completion
